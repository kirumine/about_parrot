    <h2>cockatiel</h2>
    <p>The cockatiel (/ˌkɒkəˈtiːl/;[2] Nymphicus hollandicus), also known as the weero/weiro[3][4] or quarrion,[5][6] is a medium-sized[7] parrot that is a member of its own branch of the cockatoo family endemic to Australia. They are prized as household exotic bird[8] pets and companion parrots throughout the world and are relatively easy to breed compared to other parrots. As a caged bird, cockatiels are second in popularity only to the budgerigar.[9]</p>
